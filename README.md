# TheGoodList
A compilation of ethical sources, at least according to my standards. This project is still under construction.  
:warning: means the source has not been investigated to my liking and is to be faced with some sceptisism.  
:heart_hands: means that the project gives 100% of profits to some form of charity.  
:balance_scale: means that for every product you buy, the company donates the same product to charity.

## Qualifications

- The entity should pay workers a minimum of living wage.

- If possible, the entity should ensure the supply chain(s) relied upon follows these qualifications as well.
- The entity should use the most environmentally sustainable methods of operation within reason.
