# TheGoodList
A compilation of ethical sources, at least according to my standards. This project is still under construction. This symbol :warning: means the source has not been investigated to my liking and is to be faced with some sceptisism. If that symbol is not used, you can assume the project is relatively trustworthy. :heart_hands: means that the project gives 100% of profits to some form of charity.

## Qualifications
Each company must meet the following criteria:  
- The entity should treat workers fairly.
- The entity should use sustainably sourced resources.
- If possible, the entity should ensure the supply chain(s) relied upon follows these qualifications as well.
- The entity should use the most environmentally sustainable methods of operation within reason.
- The entity must be in support of and protect minority groups (LGBTQ+, Disabled, Etc).
