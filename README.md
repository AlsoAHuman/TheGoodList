# TheGoodList
A compilation of ethical sources, at least according to my standards. This project is still under construction. This symbol :warning: means the source has not been investigating to my liking and is to be faced with some sceptisism. If that symbol is not used, you can assume the project is relatively trustworthy. :heart_hands: means that the project gives 100% of profits to some form of charity.
