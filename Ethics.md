Companies often either exploit/abuse the environment, its workers and feed wealth to the already gluttonous rich. 
With the sole purpose being only for further engrandizement of their proprietor's wealth, many companies create toxic environments that only hurt those within its influence.
This is widely known by the majority and is often ignored simply because people aren't willing to go out of their comfort zones or need to save money in the most ways possible.
This lets the rich stay rich and the middle class with their bread and circuses.
I believe it is through the nature of open source, that being goodwill and generosity, that we break this cycle; a cycle where the rich accumulate more wealth than they could spend in a lifetime while millions suffer and die each year without proper treatment.
